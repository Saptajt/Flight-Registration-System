This is my first semester project. In this project we designed a Flight Ticket reservation system using Python and Oracle SQL (Express 
edition). The software is easy to use User Interface which has been designed to allow 24/7 management 
of available airlines for a specific destination and arrival, database access and electronic documentation 
for billing purposes of the tickets with valued customer support. This feature will be used to compute 
discounts for specific customer and provide enough details of the airline which they have to catch to 
reach their desired destination.
